abstract: The importance of pandemic forecast cannot be overemphasized. We
  propose an interpretable machine learning approach for forecasting pandemic
  transmission rates by utilizing local mobility statistics and government
  policies. A calibration step is introduced to deal with time-varying
  relationships between transmission rates and predictors. Experimental results
  demonstrate that our approach is able to make accurate two-week ahead
  predictions of the state-level COVID-19 infection trends in the US. Moreover,
  the models trained by our approach offer insights into the spread of COVID-19,
  such as the association between the baseline transmission rate and the
  state-level demographics, the effectiveness of local policies in reducing
  COVID-19 infections, and so on. This work provides a good understanding of
  COVID-19 evolution with respect to state-level characteristics and can
  potentially inform local policymakers in devising customized response
  strategies.

  In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that trains regression models
  for forecasting the

  state-level COVID-19 daily transmission rates using the state-level mobility data and restrictive

  policies.
