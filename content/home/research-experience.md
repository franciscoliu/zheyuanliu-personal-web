  - title: Improving Generalization ability of GNN under Adversarial and Fairness Training
    company: Advised by Prof. Chuxu Zhang
    company_url: '"https://www.brandeis.edu/'

    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: '2022-06-01'
    date_end: ''

        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Plotted the loss landscape of GNN model under Adversarial training and Fairness data to compare the difference with regular GNN model. 
        * Researched about Mixture of Expert (MOE), Lottery ticket and model sparsity. Later, attempted to improve the generalization ability of GNN model under                   Adversarial training and Fairness data setup.
        * Analyzed the new loss landscape after modification and found the possible reason of such transformation. 

  - title: Bridging Graph and Text for Malicious Behavior Detection on Social Media
    company: Advised by Prof. Chuxu Zhang
    company_url: '"https://www.brandeis.edu/'
    company_logo: 
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: '2021-12-01'

        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Signified harmful posts/comments manually from more than 60k posts on Twitter to be served as training samples in the fine-tuning process of the model.
        * Researched about BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and helped rebuild the baseline for the project; later fine-tuned the model           to reach its best performance.
        * Assisted the first author to draft a manuscript of the work and submitted to ICDM conference. 

  - title: Network-based virus-host interaction prediction with application to SARS-CoV-2
    company: Advised by Prof. Pengyu Hong
    company_url: 'https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~hong/index.html'
    company_logo: 
    location: Waltham, MA

        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Designed the front end of the paper that displays the relationship between the protein groups of different types of coronavirus with different hosts.                   Further, by taking advantage of machine learning, the paper presented a prediction of other connections between those two protein groups.
        * Developed the [website](https://franciscoliu.github.io/detailed-virus-host.github.io/) through HTML, CSS, AJAX, Java, JQuery, etc. Imported the previous work           data of the paper from github. (Simple version of the website)
        * Updated website based on the most recent result given by the algorithm.
