  - title: Improving Generalization ability of GNN under Adversarial and Fairness Training
    company: Brandeis University
    company_url: '"https://www.brandeis.edu/'
    company_logo: 
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: '2022-06-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |3-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Plotted the loss landscape of GNN model under Adversarial training and Fairness data to compare the difference with regular GNN model. 
        * Researched about Mixture of Expert (MOE), Lottery ticket and model sparsity. Later, attempted to improve the generalization ability of GNN model under                 Adversarial training and Fairness data setup.
        * Analyzed the new loss landscape after modification and found the possible reason of such transformation. 

  - title: Bridging Graph and Text for Malicious Behavior Detection on Social Media
    company: Brandeis University
    company_url: '"https://www.brandeis.edu/'
    company_logo: 
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: '2021-12-01'
    date_end: '2022-06-01'
    description: |3-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Signified harmful posts/comments manually from more than 60k posts on Twitter to be served as training samples in the fine-tuning process of the model. 
        * Researched about BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and helped rebuild the baseline for the project; later fine-tuned the model             to reach its best performance. 
        * Assisted the first author to draft a manuscript of the work and submitted to ICDM conference.
