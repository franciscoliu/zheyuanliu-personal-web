  - title: Improving Fairness of GNN Representation by diversity discovery
    company: Advised by Prof. Chuxu Zhang
    company_url: https://chuxuzhang.github.io/
    company_logo: null
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: 2022-06-01
    date_end: ""
    description: >-2
       Responsibilities include:
       
       * Analyzed the unique property of graph fairness data. 
       * Aimed to boost the performance of GNN model on fairness graph data while alleviating the oversmoothing problem.
       * Enriched the representation diversity of model from three perspectives: the node embedding of fairness graph data, learned representation across different             experts in [Mixed of Expert (MOE)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/mixture-of-experts/), and learned representation across different-depth layers.
       * Analyzed loss landscape of the model to  empirically and theoretically explain the effectiveness of diversity learning. 
       * Successfully improved the accuracy of a newly designed GNN based model under adversarial training and fairness data while restraining the oversmooth problem           from happening.
  - title: Bridging Graph and Text for Malicious Behavior Detection on Social Media
    company: Advised by Prof. Chuxu Zhang
    company_url: https://chuxuzhang.github.io/
    company_logo: null
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: 2021-12-01
    date_end: 2022-06-01
    description: >-2
       Responsibilities include:
       
       * Signified harmful posts/comments manually from more than 60k posts on Twitter to be served as training samples in the fine-tuning process of the model.
       * Researched about BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and helped rebuild the baseline for the project; later fine-tuned the model           to reach its best performance.
       * Assisted the first author to draft a manuscript of the work and submitted to ICDM conference. 
  - title: Network-based virus-host interaction prediction with application to
      SARS-CoV-2
    company: Advised by Prof. Pengyu Hong
    company_url: https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~hong/index.html
    company_logo: null
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: 2021-05-01
    date_end: 2021-08-01
    description: >-2
       Responsibilities include:
       
       * Designed the front end of the paper that displays the relationship between the protein groups of different types of coronavirus with different hosts.                   Further, by taking advantage of machine learning, the paper presented a prediction of other connections between those two protein groups.
       * Developed the [website](https://franciscoliu.github.io/detailed-virus-host.github.io/) through HTML, CSS, AJAX, Java, JQuery, etc. Imported the previous work           data of the paper from [github](https://github.com/hangyu98/IMSP). (Simple version of the [website](https://franciscoliu.github.io/francisco.github.io-virus-host/))
       * Updated website based on the most recent result given by the algorithm. 
  - title: Visualizing the COVID-19 Trend Prediction
    company: Advised by Pengyu Hong

    company_logo: null
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: 2020-08-01
    date_end: 2020-12-01
    description: >-2
       Responsibilities include:
       
       * Designed a [website](https://franciscoliu.github.io/covid-19-prediction.github.io/) to hold data of a machine learning algorithm that predicted the                     COVID-19 trend based on the ground truth using Javascript, HTML, CSS, AJAX, Python. 
       * Pulled data from Airtable and transferred it using Python to make it compatible with the website. Later combined with front end to be user friendly.
       * Co-published the [work](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.04.21249218v1.full) to medRxiv.
