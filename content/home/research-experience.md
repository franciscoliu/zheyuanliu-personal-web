  - title: Improving Fairness of GNN Representation by diversity discovery
    company: Advised by Prof. Chuxu Zhang
    company_url: https://chuxuzhang.github.io/
    company_logo: null
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: 2022-06-01

    description: >-2
       Responsibilities include:
       
       * Analyzed the unique property of graph fairness data. 
       * Aimed to boost the performance of GNN model on fairness graph data while alleviating the oversmoothing problem.
       * Enriched the representation diversity of model from three perspectives: the node embedding of fairness graph data, learned representation across different             experts in [Mixed of Expert (MOE)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/mixture-of-experts/), and learned representation across different-depth layers.
       * Analyzed loss landscape of the model to  empirically and theoretically explain the effectiveness of diversity learning. 
       * Successfully improved the accuracy of a newly designed GNN based model under adversarial training and fairness data while restraining the oversmooth problem           from happening.
  - title: Bridging Graph and Text for Malicious Behavior Detection on Social Media
    company: Advised by Prof. Chuxu Zhang
    company_url: https://chuxuzhang.github.io/
    company_logo: null
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: 2021-12-01
    date_end: 2022-06-01
    description: >-2
       Responsibilities include:
       
       * Signified harmful posts/comments manually from more than 60k tweets to serve as positive/negative samples during the training process.
       * Collected project related information (e.g. BERT, GNN and contrasive learning), and helped run experiments on baseline models.
       * Helped run the experiments on new designed model over two tasks: malicious user detection and malicious tweet detection.  
       * Assisted the first author to draft a manuscript of the work and submitted to [ICDM](https://icdm22.cse.usf.edu/) conference. 
  - title: Network-based virus-host interaction prediction with application to
      SARS-CoV-2
    company: Advised by Prof. Pengyu Hong
    company_url: https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~hong/index.html
    company_logo: null
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: 2021-05-01
    date_end: 2021-08-01
    description: >-2
       Responsibilities include:
       
       * Designed the [website](https://franciscoliu.github.io/detailed-virus-host.github.io/) through front end languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, etc.) to             display the relationship between the protein groups of different types of coronavirus with different hosts.
       * Imported the previous work data of the paper from [github](https://github.com/hangyu98/IMSP) to construct website, which can be used to identify                       potential infected host groups based on similar structure of the protein groups. (Simple version of the [website](https://franciscoliu.github.io/francisco.github.io-virus-host/)) 
       * Updated website based on the most recent result given by the algorithm. 
  - title: Visualizing the COVID-19 Trend Prediction
    company: Advised by Pengyu Hong
    company_url: https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~hong/index.html
    company_logo: null
    location: Waltham, MA
    date_start: 2020-08-01
    date_end: 2020-12-01
    description: >-2
       Responsibilities include:
       
       * Designed a [website](https://franciscoliu.github.io/covid-19-prediction.github.io/) to hold data of a machine learning algorithm that predicted the COVID-19 trend based on the ground truth using front end languages (Javascript, HTML, CSS, etc. ) and python.
       * Pulled data from Airtable and transferred it using Python to make it compatible with the website.
       * Modified the website to be user-friendly, which also serves as a platform to compare the groundtruth/predicted cases of each state.
       * Co-published the [work](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.04.21249218v1.full) to medRxiv.
